# SQL Data Analysis and Automation for Sales Insights: A Business Report Project
In this project, I analyzed sales data using SQL and database management techniques to understand what products were selling the most at each store and spot patterns in customer behavior. I built both detailed and summary tables to support the analysis, and used custom transformations, triggers, stored procedures, and job scheduling tools to automate and update the data regularly. The project provided insights into sales performance, customer targeting, and inventory management, and itâ€™s a strong example of my SQL and business analytics skills.
